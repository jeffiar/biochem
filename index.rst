Jeffjar's Notes on Biochemistry
================================

How do cells work? How does life-like behavior emerge out of the wigglings and jigglings of floppy molecules? Biochemistry tells the remarkable story of how life is created out of the hard laws of physics -- often in crafty, surprising, and beautiful ways. For many years, I've been puzzled by Nature's magical inner workings, and over the course of my undergrad, I've developed my own viewpoint on biochemistry, based on statistical mechanics and physics-flavored thinking.

I'm writing up a few notes on biochemistry for a number of reasons:

- to share my fascination of Nature's marvels!
- to practice clear scientific writing.
- to refresh and solidify my own understanding of biochemistry.
- to put out my quirky but careful scientific reasoning.

*Who's my target audience?* Well, I think I'll target the most natural audience: a younger version of myself who's just at the brink of learning biochemistry. (Writing for a mini-jeffjar will also let my own scientific voice shine through!) Back then, I had a cursory knowledge of statistical mechanics, and I could recognize basic organic molecules, but not much more, I think. So in these notes, I'll build off that knowledge, and I'll include any relevant background beyond introductory physics and organic chemistry.

I hope these notes will be enjoyable to read.

Outline
-------

- Statistical Mechanics

  - Motivation: This governs what life can do and cannot do!
  - Fundamental assumptions and enembles; philosophy about timescales
  - Equilibrium vs steady-state
  - The Boltzman factor and free energy; binding affinities
  - Free-energy-couples and ATP; overall energy flow
  - Concentrations, entropy, chemical potentials?
  - Diffusion and fluctuations

- Protein structure and dynamics

  - Motivation: The building blocks of cellular machines
  - Amino acid structure and chemistry
  - 1,2,3,4 structure and "the folding question"
  - Lengthscales and timescales. Dynamics, energetics, etc.

- Cellular structure

  - Motivation: What are the parts of the puzzle?
  - Central dogma, cellular components. Basic lengthscales/timescales.
  - DNA/RNA structure and function. Physical properties, free energy challenges.
  - Lipid physical chemistry.
  - "Macromolecular crowding" and the cellular interior.

- Enzymology

  - Motivation: How does biology do chemistry?
  - Michaelis-Menten kinetics (phenomenology).
  - Bells'n'whistles: inhibition, multi-step, multi-substrate, cooperativity, etc.
  - P.chem theories of catalysis.
  - Philosophy of "switching ensembles" and the 2nd law?
  - Examples of types of possible reactions. Co-factors.

- Metabolism

  - Motivation: What exact chemistry underlies bioenergetics?
  - Macro-scale catabolism/anabolism, extracting free energy from food.
  - Themes of small chemical steps, specificity, regulation, localization, Delta-G coupling
  - The canonical pathway: glycolysis/citric acid cycle/respiration. Redox chem, #'s.
  - Glycolysis. G6P to keep inside cell. Regulation.
  - Citric Acid Cycle. PDH as "quinary structure". Ridiculous interior of mitochondria.
  - Respiration. ATP synthase as a free-energy-couple.

- More Metabolism

  - Motivation: Get a better sense of how Nature makes other things.
  - Nucleobase biosynthesis
  - Amino acid metabolism, the "ammonia problem".
  - Beta-oxidation, impossible chemistry.
  - Gluconeogenesis and glycogen.

- Signalling

  - GPCRs, cascades, amplification, cross-talk, timescales, logic, etc...

- Transcription and Translation

  - What happens inside DNA polymerases and ribosomes
  - Kinetic proofreading; bounds on accuracy, speed, energy usage.
